## Description:
We use Data Analytics in everyday life without even knowing it.
For eg : Going to a market to buy something .

1. ***Plan*** : We first decide which things I need before going to market . Is it a shirt , jeans , footwear etc.
2. ***Prepare*** : Next I need to check how much I am willing to spend and how to get that money.
4. ***Process*** : Then I need to check how much I want from the data. Like if I am going to buy footwear what do I want - slippers / shoes / sandals etc.
5. ***Analyze*** : You obviously won't buy things which are out of trend, Also you need to check does the jeans which you have and the color of t-shirt you want to buy, will it make a good combination.
6. ***Share*** : Now you communicate your idea to the shopkeeper to find the best suitable fit for you.
7. ***Act*** : Then you finally buy it!
