# Organizing-College-Fest-DA
## Description:
We use Data Analytics in everyday life without even knowing it.
For eg : Going to a market to buy something .
<ol>
  <li> Plan </li>
  We first decide which things I need before going to market . Is it a shirt , jeans , footwear etc.
  <li> Prepare </li>
  Next I need to check how much I am willing to spend and how to get that money.
  <li> Process </li>
  Then I need to check how much I want from the data. Like if I am going to buy footwear what do I want - slippers / shoes / sandals etc.
  <li> Analyze </li>
  You obviously won't buy things which are out of trend, Also you need to check does the jeans which you have and the color of t-shirt you want to buy, will it make a good combination.
  <li> Share </li>
  Now you communicate your idea to the shopkeeper to find the best suitable fit for you.
  <li> Act </li>
  Then you finally buy it!
</ol>
